<h2 class="subtext">Robert- Robert is qualified to be Lead Technical Engineer because he has a very creative mind, very capable of critical thinking, he was on a winning robotics team, and he has taken many designing camps over the last couple summers.</h2>
<h2 class="subtext">Wayne- Wayne is qualified of being our Task Manager because he was the leader of his middle school robotics team, and came 1st, 2nd, and 3rd in Science olympia.</h2>
    <h2 class="subtext">Joseph- Joseph is qualified to be Design Engineer because he can view a design from multiple angles to identify any flaws in the design that may prove detrimental to the drone's ability to complete the mission.</h2>
<h2 class="subtext">Joshua- Joshua is qualified for Mission Planner because he’s very good at strategy and planning things out well.</h2>
    <h1 class="subtit">RWDC Summery</h1>
    <h2 class="subtext">The RWDC challenge scenario state's that their will be 2 billion more people on earth and we will need 70% more food. The challenge wants us to come up with done to accurately disperse pesticides. They want the fastests way and biggest load of pesticides but saving cost. The challenge  focuses on unmanned drone types. You need two unmanned systems or be able to modify the first system to complete this set of tasks. 
	Each team needs to have the ability to analyze tasks, strategize, design, cost management, and incorporate alternative uses. Each member of the team needs to consider and fully understand the various interactions, dependencies, and limitations of an unmanned system. This is help further the capabilities of drones and how to upgrade them. 
    The task is to find the best way to deploy pesticides while eliminating cost of lots of them. The group that builds the best drones for the job will win. Also the best tech document of the team's activities will also get an award. So it is important to keep track of whatever any member of a person’s respective team is. The area to spread the pesticides is a 2 acre by 2 acre corn field. The uav needs to be able to carry a large amount of pesticide as well as have enough battery to fly across the entire field. The drone design needs to be focused on efficiency and minimizing costs.
