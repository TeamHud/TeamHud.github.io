                    This will be the last blog post because we only have book work left and because its due tomorrow. We have one fairly well considering our budget, timelimit, and lack of experience. We have overcome many obsticals as a team despite our problems as a team.

                After testing our drone once more outside we have come to the conclusion that we have defective/our parts stopped working.

                We figured out how to use our Speed controller to wire the motors togeather but they still don't spin at the same speed.

                    We looked online on how to make the drone work but it still isnt working. We had a major issue today and that was that when testing the props the drone fell off the table and three of the propellors broke.

             We were unable to finish the Tech Doc and it had to be submitted today and after talking with Mr. Raypole he has allowed us to submit it late so we can get it done. We will have to work diligently to get it finished in time.

             We are nearing our finish on the cad parts of the assignment but we have fallen behind in the technical document. Due to this we are now panking to get it done before the deadline.

             We have been working on our new cad for a few days and it turns out it is harder than we thought it would have been. Hopefully this setback doesnt impead our other assignments.

             Today our drone kit came in and we stumbled a little bit when we found out that most of our parts were dementioned wrong and have wrong parts. However we were ahead a decent amount so hopefullly we can stay on track.

              Today we started on our assembly of parts and finished it. We ran into a few issues of trying to get all 6 motors and props in the right place and spinning the right way. Once we figured that out it was a breeze. Wayne and Joseph also finished up what was due for our technical document for the week.
